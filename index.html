            Hi I am KripC and I like making things. Things I do range from programming, 3D animations, music compositions, and more.

            <h1 class="creationsh1">Animations based on Valorant</h1>
            <p class="creationshp">I am currently creating small animations based on video game called VALORANT, 
                using assets that have been taken from the in-game file. While the animations 
                are relatively small and short, I use it as a way for me to learn the 3D software Blender,
                video editing, composition, and more.

            <p class="creationshp">
                Back in may of 2021, I have created a website called Find Me a Linux Distro, or FMALD for short, 
                which was a website that took you to a random linux distribution websites when you clicked on the button.
                What made it interesting was that the website had the options to be taken to specific distribution based 
                linux, such as Arch, Debian, Gentoo, and more. While the domain now down, it can still be found from here:

            <h1 class="creationsh1">Blender Addon</h1>
            <p class="creationshp">
                I created an addon in Blender called Breakdown-fy, which automates animating the objects falling down 
                seen a lot in many movie / animation behind the scene videos. I created this addon after wanting to recreate 
                this effect, but finding out that the only way to achieve this is to do it by hand. it is held on github, 
                and can be downloaded for free.
