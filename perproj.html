                For a long time, I wanted to create my own 3D animations you would see in movie theatres or youtube.
                However when I tried to get into 3D animation, I was struck with hard reality that creating animation 
                is not simple as it seems on the surface. There are so many things that go into creating a 3D animaiton,
                such as:
            </p>
            <br />
            <ul>
                <li>Generating idea</li>
                <li>Gathering references</li>
                <li>Creating concept art</li>
                <li>Writing script</li>
                <li>Storyboarding</li>
                <li>Creating / getting models and assets</li>
                <li>setting up the scene</li>
                <li>Adding lightings (very important)</li>
                <li>Animating </li>
                <li>Compositing</li>
                <li>Voice acting</li>
                <li>Adding sound effects and music</li>
                <li>Editing</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These are just handful of process that goes into creating a 3D animaiton, and it could get much more
                complicated when it also includes elements such as 2D animations and motion graphics. Creating an 
                animation by individually would be a very diffult task, having to handle majority of these elements.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, I have past prior experiences of creating short 3D animations typically lasting no longer than 30 seconds.
                Through making and publishing these animations on Youtube, I have learned a lot of important skills each time,
                even if the project gets scrapped. I am determined and confident that with preparations and organized plans, 
                I will be able to create a proper animation video.

                <h3 class="projsubheading">Goals</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Create a 3D animation through similar processes that an actual animation companies or studios go through</li>
                    <li>Minimum length of 60 seconds</li>
                    <li>Learn new processes
                        <ul>

                    </li>
                    <li>Keeping the animation within the scope of myself</li>

                    This is a somewhat diffult topic, which would require some research in order to find out.
                    I believe this might be the most important part of this project, as overscoping it can lead to 
                    undesired result at the end. I would not only like to research about what I can achieve myself 
                    in the time scope, but also tools that could help me overcome the scope challenges, since with 
                    right tools, the project's process can become faster or much more efficient.
