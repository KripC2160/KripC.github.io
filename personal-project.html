                For a long time, I wanted to create my own 3D animations you would see in movie theatres or youtube.
                However when I tried to get into 3D animation, I was struck with hard reality that creating animation 
                is not simple as it seems on the surface. There are so many things that go into creating a 3D animation films.
                From screenwriting to animating to editing, there are dozens of different steps that needs to be taken 
                in order for a single 3D animation film comes to life, and it could get much more complicated when it 
                also includes elements such as 2D animations and motion graphics. Creating an animation by individually 
                would be a very difficult task, having to handle majority of these elements.
            </p>
            <p style='width: 50%; justify-content: center; margin: 0 auto; padding: 10px;'>
                What I am currently trying to create would have been practically impossible if I went in to this 
                with zero knowledge. However, I have past prior experiences of creating short 3D animations using tools 
                such as 3D software <a class='links' href="https://blender.org">Blender</a> and Adobe Premier Pro, typically 
                lasting no longer than 30 seconds. Through making and publishing these animations on my 
                <a class="links" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyTsNlXNg4TFXzCSlTq1W7A">Youtube channel</a>, I have 
                learned a lot of important skills each time, even if the project gets scrapped. I am determined and 
                confident that with preparations and organized plans, I will be able to create a proper animation video.

                  Goals for final product is to create a proper 3D animation short film and to learn new skills with it.
                    I would like to learn new processes to create the 3D animations, in order to further expand my specialty 
                    in this area. I also want to make sure the animations are minimum of 30 seconds, since I have never made any
                    animations longer than it. Most importantly, I would like to keep the project in the scope to make sure I can
                   complete the project in time. The most important ATL would be organization and management skill, in order to achieve the goal&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

                            Animation studios set a certain deadlines for each animation or shots that needs to be 
                            completed. It also usually includes extra padding for the time, as the animation might 
                            not turn out as well as expected, or there might be some issues that might occur with 
                            other departments in the animation studio. When the task can be completed earlier or 
                            the department that comes after the animators need extra time, the schedule can be 
                            moved to complete it sooner.

                                They also need to guide the audience's eyes to where the director wants people to look towards to tell the message.

                                    Pacing is very important for films, as slow paces can lose engagements 
                                    from the audiences, and too fast paces can lead to audiences feeling

                                    Usual process begins with outlining necessary characters for the voice acting,

                  My research plan helped me to not only learn new things, but also further understand the areas that 
                    I already had some experiences in. For instance, writing a script or 3D short films in general has 
                    been new, while researching further about animating better has widened my views. It also helped me to 
                    head to right path for the project, instead of being left feeling lost of direction. Most of my sources
                    came from online, ranging from online articles, videos, award regulations, and more. However, I also 
                    interviewed people from the animation industry as a source, incorporating collaboration skill through communicating 
                    with people I know and school faculty members. The credibilities of the sources varied, but I have used them accordingly 
                    and categorized them for reliability using Source Evaluation Rubric.</p>

                                Not every single step can be done due to 
                                every studios and companies having variety of them. 
                                However, I will be following the basic steps that 
                                they usually have.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In order to succeed this criteria, I will be using a 
                                website called Trello to keep track of the process. The 
                                trello board can be viewed from

                        <td>
                            <p>
                                I have not made animations over 30 seconds, 
                                leading to no story being told. The causes
                                vary from motivation, and commitment. I would 
                                like to get out of this habit and create a 
                                proper story that could be told. In real animation
                                studios, commitment is what drives the project,
                                not the motivation. Which is why this criteria 
                                is needed to ensure the project could be completed.
                            </p>

                                The scope will heavily depend on complexity of the 
                                idea, However above 30 second would be a feasible 
                                minimum requirement that I would be able to achieve,
                                even if it is challenging. In order to keep the engagement 
                                and keep the project at scope, I would also like to keep the 
                                film under 10 minutes excluding the credits.

                                I have never done a proper voice acting,
                                which made me want to include it in this 
                                project, even if minimal. Voice acting is probably 
                                one of the most important part of the films, as it  
                                immerses the audiences to the world. By using Voice 
                                acting, it could also improve my collaboration and 
                                organization skill to setup and work with people in 
                                order to complete this criteria.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I will make sure this criteria has been met through sending 
                                out surveys to make sure the voice acting is clear, and blends 
                                in with the animations themselves.

                                I don't want to just get or create assets and place them into a world 
                                without any thought. I would like them to match the world and environment that 
                                they are in. This criteria would not only require 3D models and assets, but lightings,
                                color/mood, and animations that match the story.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I will measure this criteria through sending out surveys to group of people 
                                who agree to watch and take it after the film has been completed.
                            </p>

                        <td>
                            <p>
                                I would like to make sure this product is not only successful through criteria, but 
                                also a final result to be successful as a whole. Making a great animation film requires 
                                all of the processes coming together, with every step of it being crucial to it's success.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I will measure this criteria by sending out surveys for audiences from school to  give their
                                honest ratings and their critiques. I would also post it on the social media platforms such as Youtube,
                                Instagram, Twitter, and more to ensure much more transparent reception instead of bias through likes, 
                                views, and comments.

                    researching topics that I needed to know, learn how to write scripts, and try to get myself 
                    warmed up by doing small practice with 3D.

                            During the process, I realized I could do many things in blender instead of using external softwares,
                            so I decided to use an addon that could do screenwriting, which fit my workflow much more than the 
                            software that I was using. I also decided use blender for storyboarding instead of external softwares,
                            which also may have saved more time than learning the software and attempting to create the scenes that I 
                            envisioned.

                            good advice: Quality over quantity. I wanted to add many cool things and shots while adding restrictions 
                            that I thought would make it feasible, however this isn't still enough to give enough time for each scene 
                            to get quality it deserves. I decided to reduce the scene number down to one, with the whole film revolving 
                            around it. The scene itself doesn't have enough context, so I am going to put extra dialogs or expositions
