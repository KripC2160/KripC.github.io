                For a long time, I wanted to create my own 3D animations you would see in movie theatres or youtube.
                However when I tried to get into 3D animation, I was struck with hard reality that creating animation 
                is not simple as it seems on the surface. There are so many things that go into creating a 3D animation films.
                From screenwriting to animating to editing, there are dozens of different steps that needs to be taken 
                in order for a single 3D animation film comes to life, and it could get much more complicated when it 
                also includes elements such as 2D animations and motion graphics. Creating an animation by individually 
                would be a very difficult task, having to handle majority of these elements.
            </p>
            <p style='width: 50%; justify-content: center; margin: 0 auto; padding: 10px;'>
                What I am currently trying to create would have been practically impossible if I went in to this 
                with zero knowledge. However, I have past prior experiences of creating short 3D animations using tools 
                such as 3D software <a class='links' href="https://blender.org">Blender</a> and Adobe Premier Pro, typically 
                lasting no longer than 30 seconds. Through making and publishing these animations on my 
                <a class="links" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyTsNlXNg4TFXzCSlTq1W7A">Youtube channel</a>, I have 
                learned a lot of important skills each time, even if the project gets scrapped. I am determined and 
                confident that with preparations and organized plans, I will be able to create a proper animation video.

                <p>
                    Goals for final product is to create a proper 3D animation short film and to learn new skills with it.
                    I would like to learn new processes to create the 3D animations, in order to further expand my specialty 
                    in this area. I also want to make sure the animations are minimum of 90 seconds, since I have never made any
                    animations longer than it. Most importantly, I would like to keep the project in the scope to make sure I can
                    complete the project in time.

                                In order to succeed this criteria, I will be using a

                                I have not made animations over 30 seconds, 
                                leading to no story being told. The causes
                                vary from motivation, and commitment. I would 
                                like to get out of this habit and create a 
                                proper story that could be told.

                                idea, However the 90 seconds would be a feasible 
                                minimum requirement that I would be able to achieve,
                                even if it is challenging.

                                which made me want to include it in this 
                                project, even if minimal. By using Voice acting, 
                                it could also improve my collaboration and organization

                                in with the animations themselves.

                                without any thought. I would like them to match the world and environment that 
                                they are in. This criteria would not only require 3D models and assets, but lightings,
                                color/mood, and animations that match the story.

                                who agree to watch and take it.

                                I would like to make sure this product is not only successful through criteria, but 
                                also a final result to be successful as a whole. Making a great animation film requires 
                                all of the processes coming together, with every step of it being crucial to it's success.

                                I will measure this criteria by sending out surveys for audiences from school to  give their
                                honest ratings and their critiques. I would also post it on the social media platforms such as Youtube,
                                Instagram, Twitter, and more to ensure much more transparent reception instead of bias through likes, 
                                views, and comments.
